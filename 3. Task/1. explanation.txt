Main idea for creating and populating table from 3. task using any scripting language
is implementing data structure that represents twodimensional array and than populate it according to criteria.

- 1. step would be determing/extracting values of column/row headings (first row and first column) 

Values of column/row headings would be all unique values of 'Expense area' and 'Expense Type' columns.
Creating two empty arrays that represent lists of unique values.
Iterating through source table, checking if values 'Expense area' and 'Expense Type' of particular row already exists
 in above mentioned arrays. If not adding them.   

- 2. step would be creating structure that could represent 2 dimensional array    

The idea that led me was cross product of all unique values of 'Expense' area and 'Expense Type'.
I tried to implement this in javascript through array of objects where each one has 3 properties.
Two of them are values 'Expense area' and 'Expense Type' columns respectivly.
Third one represent total sum of values from 'AP Amount (£)' column for given row/column value pair.

- 3. step would be populating 'table' like structure from 2. step
   
Iterating through every row in source table, finding out what are the values of 'Expense area' and 'Expense Type' columns
 and based on this values finding out correct object in correct created in 2. step. After that increasing 
its third property by value of 'AP Amount (£)' column
